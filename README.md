Secure storage of files backed by Arm TrustZone on the STM32MP157F-DK2.

## Motivation

Applications can have various secure storage requirements:
- Storing cryptographic material such as public and private keys for use in secure processes 
- Storing private user data in such a way that only the user can read it
- Storing data in such a way that it cannot be tampered with

In today's security landscape it is attractive to encapsulate such secure storage systems in trusted execution environments (TEE) that run with higher security guarantees, without the security problems of typical rich execution environments (REE). A simple secure store offering an API for writing data could be architected between:

- a REE client application that communicates with the TEE whenever a secure storage service is required, for example to store some data buffer under some identifier string `tag`
- a TEE trusted application that responds to requests to store, tagged with `tag`, a data buffer encrypted in such a way that only the TEE can decrypt it later

## Development Environment: STM32MP157F-DK2

We picked the STM32MP157F-DK2 board for exploring secure storage on Arm TrustZone for its rich security feature set (secure boot, cryptographic engine, TPM integration). This board is well supported on the OP-TEE (a secure operating system designed for running on TEE) and the Arm Trusted Firmware (open source firmware for first stage bootloaders). It is also clear that ST offers excellent documentation, for getting started as well as diving deeper in the tech stack.

### Hardware

### Flash Layout

The board has an eMMC interface with a microSD that is used as the main flash memory. Besides the boot ROM, it is where all software is stored. Flashing software on this board effectively means to write to the microSD card, according to a flash layout.

When the board configuration switches are set to

### Software Packages

We used the following software packages as described by ST:

- Starter Package: en.flash-stm32mp1-openstlinux-6-1-yocto-mickledore-mp1-v23-06-21.tar.gz
- Developer Package
    - en.sources-stm32mp1-openstlinux-6.1-yocto-mickledore-mp1-v23.06.21.tar.gz
    - en.SDK-x86_64-stm32mp1-openstlinux-6.1-yocto-mickledore-mp1-v23.06.21.tar.gz

We use the starter package to flash an initial working version of the entire software stack on the board, which in ST's documentation also serves as an introduction to their platform and validation that the board is working. It consists of partition images, flash layout descriptions, binaries for OpenSTLinux, etc.

The developer package (containing an entire BSP with compiler toolchains, source code, device trees) is used to build versions of individual software components that can be "overlayed" within the flashed partition images (which can be mounted and modified on a host computer). Alternatively the developer package can also be used to build concrete partition images that can completely replaced the already flashed partition images.

ST also describes something called the "distribution package" which is intended for final release and distribution in commercial products, not for convenient development and engineering. We did not use this because it did not concern us pedagogically.

### Secure Boot Chain

1. The ROM code starts the processor in secure mode. It supports the FSBL authentication and offers authentication services to the FSBL.
2. The First stage bootloader (FSBL) is executed from the SYSRAM. Among other things, this bootloader initializes (part of) the clock tree and the DDR controller. Finally, the FSBL loads the second-stage bootloader (SSBL) into the DDR external RAM and jumps to it. The bootloader stage 2, so called TF-A BL2, is the Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) binary used as FSBL on STM32MP15.
3. Second stage bootloader (SSBL) U-Boot is commonly used as a bootloader in embedded software and it is the one used on STM32MP15.
4. LinuxÂ® OS is loaded in DDR by U-Boot and executed in the non-secure context.
5. Secure OS / Secure monitor. The Cortex-A7 secure world supports OP-TEE secure OS which is loaded by TF-A BL2.

Attached in `boot_log.txt` is a copy of the entire boot log found in the serial port of the device. The `stlink.sh` contains a small script to get these logs by connecting to the ST-LINK serial port which is available through a fronnt-facing micro USB interface on the board.

## Implementation

The focus of this work is on the interaction between Trusted Applications (running on the secure world) and Host Applications (running on the non secure world).

### OP-TEE OS

For our goals and requirements, the OP-TEE OS itself must be configured with special build system configuration options, and recompiled into the FIP image to be flashed on the FIP partition.

while ! ls -lah $of ; do 
	echo "Please mount the microSD card"
	sleep 5

```

Specifically we cared to configure:
- `CFG_REE_FS` to enable the file storage initiated by the TEE on the REE
- `CFG_WITH_USER_TA` to enable user loaded trusted applications (otherwise your host applications will not find your trusted applications)
- `CFG_EMBED_DTB_SOURCE_FILE` and `DEVICETREE` to minimally point to our board rather than the whole ecosystem of boards

### OP-TEE Trusted Application

Trusted application is in `festore/ta/`.

### OpenSTLinux Client Application

Client application is in `festore/host/`.
